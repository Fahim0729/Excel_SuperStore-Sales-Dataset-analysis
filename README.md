# SuperStore Sales Dashboard (2019–2020)
## Introduction

Built an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze two years (2019–2020) of SuperStore sales. The analysis includes gender, age group, payment method, product sub-category, and other dimensions, with slicers for dynamic filtering to explore the data interactively.

## Data Preparation and Exploratory Analysis

Feature Engineering: Derived month and year from the Order Date column and categorized Age into three meaningful age groups using conditional logic (IF statements).

Exploratory Analysis: Used pivot tables and pivot charts—including pie, column, line, bar, and combo (column + line) charts—to summarize data and generate insights.


## Sales Insights and Key Findings

Gender-based purchasing patterns: Women are responsible for 70% of total sales, while men account for 30%. Women also show higher sales performance than men across all age groups.

Seasonal trends: A clear overall seasonal pattern was identified, with December emerging as the highest-selling month, while February consistently recorded the lowest sales volume.
