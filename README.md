Introduction
Built an interactive Excel dashboard to analyse two years (2019-20) of superstore sales by gender, age group, payment method, product sub category and so on, using slicers for dynamic filtering. 

Data Preparation and Exploratory Analysis
•	As part of data preparation, the Order Date column is used to derive month and year variables, while the age variable is categorized into three meaningful age groups using conditional logic (IF statements).
•	Pivot tables and pivot charts—including pie, column, line, bar, and combo (column and line) charts—were used for exploratory data analysis and reporting.
Sales insights and key findings
1.	Customer purchasing patterns revealed a significant gender-based disparity, with women responsible for roughly 70% of all sales, while men accounted for the remaining 30%. Furthermore, women show higher sales performance than men in every age group.
2.	A clear seasonal pattern was identified, with December emerging as the highest-selling month, while January consistently recorded the lowest sales volume
3.	This dashboard also highlights the highest-revenue product sub-categories and the top five high-value customers, helping focus on the most profitable areas.
4.	Slicers for year and payment method are added to view category-wise performance for specific selections.
